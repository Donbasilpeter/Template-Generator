your task is to modify and create an optimized code that meets all the requirements.
look for possible bugs and fix them.
make the app more professional and creative.
add files only if nessasary.
output should be a single json file just like the input code.
The only valid output is a json file without any other messages.
check if all fucntions are working properly.
add functions if any are missing.
Don't call any  apis unless told to do so. 
don't use apis with api key.
Components should be responsive.
